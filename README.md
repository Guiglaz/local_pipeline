# Standard_analysis_pipeline
A repo with all the code you need to go from your raw files to hundreds of fully characterized ganglion cells


Once downloaded the repository all the code runs in python. A standard anaconda distribution will do. The use of jupyter is advised but not necessary. All the dependencies needed are basic and should be already present in the python distribution of choice.

The analysis of this pipeline are nice and most of all are free. Take advantage of them!
